# Live Upload

You probably want to use your favorite editor like VS Code to edit your .js and .css files.
Eventhough the APEX editor wastly improved in past recent version, it is still not great for a complex work.

How to use this? You run this script in your command line and whatever file you will change from that point
will be automatically and instantly uploaded to your (application or workspace) static files.
All you have to do it to save your file and before you switch back to APEX, the file will be there.

```
adt live_upload -app {APP_ID}
```

Check help to see more options:
```
adt live_upload
```
